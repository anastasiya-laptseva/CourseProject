"foolCard_map_description" = "The Jester card comes at number zero in the deck, which gives it infinite potential. Jester usually falls to a person who has yet to build his life. This lasso represents innocence. Therefore, Jester usually means the beginning of a new journey that will form character, fill you with optimism and get rid of restrictions. In addition, this lasso can be seen as a call for risky decisions. Jester inspires courageous deeds because it understands that every day is a chance to discover something new and experience an amazing range of emotions and feelings, consisting of anticipation, surprise, awe and curiosity. The lasso shows that you can never say with certainty what lies ahead for you, but you must joyfully welcome everything that comes into your life. The jester prefers to plunge headlong into the vicissitudes of life, even without first understanding the situation. He does not think about the problems and dangers that await on the route. His soul strives for experiments with reality and the search for novelty. This is an energetic and joyful optimist who is 100% sure that life is preparing exceptionally exciting and interesting adventures. Of course, he can face dangers and unplanned situations, but this does not awaken fear and anxiety in the Jester.";
"magicianCard_map_description" = "The magician is a very energetic and positive card, and it calls for an equally energetic and creative action on your part (“you wanted to do it yourself”). The magician says you have power. Right now, you have been given the ability to control the course of events and control your environment. Tighten your will and mind - and you will be able to subjugate the elements in the game, people, resources, the driving forces of action. The magician says that the whole process, about which the question is asked, takes place under your direct control, you are the main character, and therefore it is up to you to decide in which direction the situation should be turned. As a rule, the Magician's card says that the present time is a period of relative safety and success, when it is quite possible to create favorable conditions for yourself and generally take something under your control. The card makes it clear that there are all opportunities to transform and improve your life. According to the Magician, changes usually come from the questioner himself, although it also happens that some external factor transforms life (surrounding cards can give a hint of this). The magician is a kind of warning that now actions (including those at the level of intentions, desires and imagination) will have increased effectiveness. Life is full of miracles. And last but not least, you need to learn to control your thoughts, because now it is consciousness that determines being.";
"highpriestessCard_map_description" = "Sometimes the Priestess is simply an indication of some female person (wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, boss, rival). But more often the Second Arcana of the Tarot symbolizes the presence of mystery. Other cards of the layout can give a hint about her character. It is difficult to find out this secret right off the bat, it will be revealed in due time. She is a mentor, but she does not teach everyone, but those who trust the wisdom of unconscious forces and the mysterious inner world. Not surprisingly, women do it a little better. The Arcana of the Great Priestess advises you to pay attention to “minor coincidences” and listen carefully to various kinds of clues, pointers on the path of life (that is, hold on to every sign that you for some reason realized as addressed to yourself). The priestess personifies your unconscious forces - intuition, premonition, often inexplicable, but quite firm confidence in something. This is the key to that mysterious truth that eludes the logically thinking mind. It is necessary to pay attention to the subconscious, dreams. The knowledge you're looking for is within you, and to find it, you have to bypass your cool mind. The main meaning of the Priestess is wisdom, knowledge, understanding, the ability to learn, teach, comprehend the mysteries and initiate the mysteries.";
"empressCard_map_description" = "The Empress embodies the awakening of nature and the energy of abundance. This is a good card, there is every reason to rejoice at its presence in the layout. It portends a busy time, rich in satisfying events. The situation favors the questioner, and events develop quite quickly. The Empress has a colossal life-giving energy, so there is every reason to believe that what has been dormant for a long time will wake up under her influence and give new strong shoots, whether it be a new project, personal relationships, a course of recovery, building a house, or a dissertation once abandoned . Any business under her auspices flourishes and grows. At the highest level, it symbolizes the Veil and has the essential meaning of Protection, guardianship over the fate of the questioner, at least at the present time. Traditional meanings are fruitful development, progress, active creation, realization of opportunities. In the upright position, it symbolizes creation, beauty and goodness in daily and material affairs, in feelings and thoughts. Her motherly gifts are security, physical and emotional comfort, enjoyment of life, a celebration of body and soul, sometimes a gift of mutual love.";
"emperorCard_map_description" = "The card speaks of stability, reliability, patronage, assistance, promotion of growth and the implementation of plans. Protecting what has been achieved, setting boundaries, accepting great responsibility. Clear, clear, useful and effective actions, prudence, proximity to reality. The presence of this card in the layout immediately adds strength and constancy to the matter. But that's not all - the Emperor is in charge of such values ​​as influence, authority, power and glory. After all, he is the Emperor for a reason! This Arkan is a symbol of firmness and power. The emperor as a whole belongs to the group of positive Arcana and his appearance in the layout is very, very good. It's just that for many people, its impact seems too harsh. Well, with the most august persons, presumably, it is not easy. Someone is having difficulty building relationships with the Empress. With regard to the Emperor, there are simply more such people. The card in the layout speaks of actions from a position of strength, with the conviction that one is right. The main meaning of this Arcana is the realization of ideas. That is why it can be considered positive.";
"hierophantCard_map_description" = "The Hierophant points mainly to three things: questions of ethics, the process of learning and participation in some kind of rituals and ceremonies. This may be the conclusion of an official marriage. It gives a positive answer to the question of the possibility or need to learn or teach, as well as the possibility or need to formalize relationships. The deeper meanings of the card are true religiosity, following the shepherd, mentorship and deep knowledge, the search for meaning and its acquisition. The hierophant often falls out when you are trying to explain what is happening to you in terms of some teaching, whether it be homeopathy, Orthodoxy, Viennese psychoanalysis, Indian astrology, or anything else (the spectrum is unlimitedly wide, and the teaching itself can exist for two thousand years, so and two months). In other words, you begin to think, interpret and evaluate your life experience, seeing in it some additional meaning. Often this is really a flash of interest in the church, an appeal to historically significant views and principles.";
"lovesCard_map_description" = "Card meaning - Choice! Intrapersonal conflict is what the Lovers portend. That far from blissful state, when it seems that it is impossible to make a decision, and the usually intelligible inner voice turns into a many-headed hydra, which begins to sing in chorus out of place, they say, the heart is not a stone, but the brain is not semolina ... Just a conflict between the heart and the mind manifests itself most sharply, although this is not necessary (but if the Three of Swords is nearby, for example, then it is necessary). At this moment in your life, you are somehow at a crossroads and are faced with the need to make a choice, and a very important one, and fraught with long-term consequences. Lovers always warn that this choice will come back to haunt you (or maybe the decision will affect the rest of your life). Of course, in the most typical case, this is a choice between suppressing the desire or giving in to it. This choice may concern not only a partner, but also a profession, travel, educational institution, home, car or lifestyle in general. Moreover, alternatives, as a rule, are mutually exclusive, it is impossible to sit on two chairs. Ancient interpretations emphasize the positive meaning of the Lovers - falling out in a layout, this card tells you that the right choice will be made! Lovers is a card of sincere deeds performed “not according to the law, but according to the soul”, fully expressing the true aspirations of a person. Of course, passionate love also applies here.";
"chariotCard_map_description" = "There is a significant leap forward in life. A person is able to overcome obstacles, he has confidence in himself and his own abilities. Thanks to the layout of this card, a person can take large-scale actions, both in professional activities and on the personal front. Everything you want comes true, the enemies retreat, there are no obstacles on the way to success. And even if quite recently there were still difficulties, then with the Chariot card you need to get rid of past problems and take the first step towards your success. The past should be left behind, because a new life stage awaits a person ahead. He will be full of strength and determination, show his courage and discover a new world. The chariot, as it were, pushes a person to take on some new unfamiliar business for him. As a rule, this card falls to those people who really strive to find themselves, are drawn to something new, and they are literally overwhelmed with energy and enthusiasm. They are active and optimistic, and always strive to achieve their goals.";
"strengthCard_map_description" = "This Arcana is considered positive, contains a fairly large amount of energy, and calls to bravely and decisively resist the vicissitudes of fate. Strength heralds a test of endurance and speaks of the need for patience and courage. The strength in the alignment is evidence that so far a person has been on the right path, and now he has to test his mind, check. This is a card of the inner strength needed to overcome obstacles along the way and to remain steadfast in the face of difficult circumstances. Usually, this need to be strong for the sake of others or oneself involves curbing one's own feelings, whether it be passion, longing or disappointment. Man has been challenged, and cowardice and weak will are out of place now! What is to be experienced must be accepted calmly, patiently and without losing self-confidence. Achieving emotional maturity is now the most important task. Raging or pitying yourself, you will not solve it. Strength often falls out when a person feels that he is in a rather dangerous situation, and he has to, relatively speaking, enter the lion's den, armed only with his convictions (I recall the biblical prophets and the lives of the saints). The traditional meaning of the Force is positive: overcoming obstacles (with the strength of the spirit shown), victory over unforeseen circumstances. This is a card of willpower, energy, resilience and triumph. Its function is to give strength to subdue an external or internal enemy (for example, to overcome weaknesses). In the layout, it denotes the opportunity to succeed and the advice to act gently, unobtrusively and at the same time fearlessly. If the alignment is done for some kind of crisis situation, the Force clearly indicates that a person has the strength to do everything necessary and cope with it, and quite easily and confidently. The main thing is that he should not doubt for a second his ability to do this!";
"hermitCard_map_description" = "The hermit emphasizes the desire to withdraw and the need for introspection, finding inner peace and one's own truth, following one's own path. He says it's time to re-evaluate your life, your goals and your connections. It's time to move away from social life a little, leave petty worries and entertainment that has become familiar: they interfere with thinking about the soul. Each person needs a period of solitude (“hermitage”) in order to finally understand himself. However, this is not just a timeout, in general, the vibrations of the Hermit are noticeably superior to the Four of Swords. They announce being in their own center and finding their own light. The main thing that proclaims the Ninth Arcanum is the refusal to be guided by other people's opinions (only one's own!), the refusal to do anything contrary to oneself, one's inner sense of true and true, for the sake of others or simply according to universal concepts. This is a card of spiritual independence and great personal strength, enough to walk your own narrow path, despite the absence of fellow travelers (or at least public approval).";
"wheelOfFortuneCard_map_description" = "This is a card of change and is traditionally considered a good omen! The Wheel of Fortune brings change and, as a rule, good luck, but at the same time it informs us that the situation is not under our control, and the plans are in the power of surprises of fate beyond our control. At the event level, it indeed often corresponds to situations where we can do nothing, and which at the same time affect the very foundations of the established course of things. But whatever is done is for the best, and these situations can be defined more as a “happy accident” than a “complete ambush”. Everything will turn out in favor of the questioner without any special volitional efforts on his part (although the feeling of complete inscrutableness and “accidentality” of what is happening can blow in a cool breeze - what if I came five minutes later? What if ... .? scary to think, everything would be different!). But that's the trick of the Tenth Arcanum, that you can not think about it. Fate synchronizes everything with truly cosmic precision. The Wheel of Fortune is one of the most mystical cards. Often, this card is in charge of questions of returning to something, some kind of recurring situations. In life, everything repeats itself, including purely karmic, everything returns to normal - feelings, thoughts, events. This card speaks of resignation to fate, of “the moment comes” and a return to our destiny, about something over which we have no control.";
"justiceCard_map_description" = "The practical significance of the tarot card justice (justice) in relation to the Questioner is not only in the confusion of the trial, but in general in any area where judgments are made or disputes are resolved. If a person is waiting for a court decision, the card says that it will be in his favor. On the other hand, the Tarot Card Justice (Justice) requires a person to find a balance between conflicting forces, material and spiritual, physical and mental, reasonable and intuitive. Papers are waiting for you, legal activities that will affect you in any way. Perhaps the cases are controversial - a divorce, and sometimes about compensation for any loss. In the psychological sphere, the Tarot Card Justice (Justice) is a symbol of balance of spirit and the ability to find a common language with other people - especially in important matters, it means maturity and life experience. The card speaks of the need for a thorough assessment of all sides of the case in order to make the right decision. Reminds of the need for balance, impartiality. Also, the card may indicate the upcoming court (but it can be both a contest and a competition). Act legally and honestly, then there will be success. Any lie, deception can lead to defeat.";
"hangedCard_map_description" = "Bears inability to external activity, imprisonment in the monastery of the spirit. The will is bound hand and foot, all the forces are spent on spiritual work, changing the assemblage point. Under the pressure of external obligations, one's own passivity is perceived painfully. In any case, you feel not free in your decisions: you cannot do either what you want or what you need. It is necessary to gain patience and humility, to remain calm, to wait, to perceive the situation from its bright side. It can drop when there is a fairly clear idea of ​​what needs to be done, but something does not allow this action to be taken. The map indicates a hopeless, dead-end situation. At the same time, this does not mean at all that there is no way out of the situation at all - it simply cannot (or is very difficult) be done in the usual way. It is necessary to change the perception of reality and the course of action, only then can you get out of the current situation. The Hanged Man can also talk about the fact that a person is under strong pressure, he is forced to act in a certain way, or simply used. Sometimes the Hanged Man can indicate that a person is in isolation. The card also has a lighter meaning - it can indicate a willingness to make a sacrifice for the sake of higher goals, or the fact that the right behavior can help even in adverse circumstances to gain a benefit. But at the same time, the sacrifice must be conscious and voluntary. Otherwise, you still have to lose something, but the choice will already be up to fate, and who knows what she will choose.";
"deathCard_map_description" = "The card indicates that something in your life has come to a logical conclusion (died, outlived). But do not despair, because after the completion of one business, the beginning of new business, the birth of new ideas and projects will definitely follow. This can be related to both personal relationships and work. Also, the card may indicate that a person will have to part or say goodbye to his affairs forever, perhaps he himself will refuse something. The Death card actually symbolizes change, and change can be liberation. This card suggests that the old ways of acting will no longer be useful, the old patterns of thinking, too. All this can be derailed, because it does not allow you to move forward to new opportunities. Death is as much a part of life as the daily sunset and dawn. Death or change is not to be feared. Change affects everyone, regardless of wealth or poverty. This card usually means not physical death, but the death of the former self or the former mode of action. The main idea of ​​the card is change and transformation.";
"moderationCard_map_description" = "A lucky card that characterizes beauty, joy, peace and harmony, light and restoration. The card has a beneficial effect on a person and his activities. A person has to go through some kind of test.
Thanks to the lasso, disagreements and tense situations will take place in a more relaxed form. Regardless of the circumstances, you can count on things to calm down and clear up. There will be no hopeless situations. If something seemed out of reach, it will happen very soon. But the main thing is that a person should show his patience and self-control. The card implies adaptation and compromise, humility and humility. This card represents balance, balance, coordination, and the ability to live and work in harmony with others. Drawing this card means you have these qualities. Your attitude towards life reflects a strong sense of personal integrity and the ability to manage emotional and intellectual qualities in dealing with other people. Everything is stable and balanced in your personal and business spheres, and you are calm and content with life. However, it is important that you maintain this sense of calm and stability. Be patient as you explore new opportunities and save up for the future.";
"devilCard_map_description" = "The lasso has a bad meaning and indicates that a person is not able to keep the situation under control, and because of this, he incurs a lot of trouble. The Devil card says that a person stumbled, and his actions led to self-destruction and degradation. The card warns that you should not indulge your weaknesses and follow their lead. Even carnal strength can be called self-indulgence. A person under the influence of this card will obey someone or depend on someone. It just won't lead to anything good. Some personality will appear in the environment, which will have power over him, depriving him of his freedom and a fulfilling life. Also, the card can mean that a person is tormented by his dark past, and he is dependent on him. The Devil card can easily lead a person astray, it shows how he plays with fire. In life, strong hobbies may appear that will harm duties, and because of passion, a person will lose his conscience.";
"towerCard_map_description" = "The key word of this card is crisis. Explosion or scrapping, destruction, betrayal, loss after the previous injection. In a certain sense, this is a punishment for what was before. It is the Expulsion of the Devil (previous Arcana). The ancient name of the Tower is the House of God. This is worth thinking about. This is the House of the Devil (as the map was called in medieval Italy), which, under a stroke of heavenly lightning, turns into a place of the presence of God. Through the Tower there is a liberation from a false, not conducive to the development of aspiration, through the destruction of what a person believed in and what he strongly aspired to. There is a loss of the achieved balance, based on false grounds. The Tower is the orderly of evolution, it heals our life from everything that poisons it, destroys stagnant situations that hinder growth. At the same time, the blows of fate may seem as tragic and incomprehensible as it seems to a child who is being dragged to the doctor to remove a bad tooth. Few people perceive these cleansing operations with enthusiasm, but they are still needed. The tower shows that the walls behind which we hid (or hid something) are crumbling. One period of life is replaced by another, and this happens very rapidly, and therefore not painlessly. In the simplest sense, the card symbolizes the end of the existing situation under the influence of external forces, moreover, unexpected and very fast. It can be either just reactive cleansing, or a total collapse of the current situation (at least in the area of ​​the question being asked). The tower pulls a person out of the circumstances limiting him, violates the long-existing state of affairs. Sometimes this is completely in line with the expectations and even the desires of the questioner, so the Tower is not always so bad. Next to positive cards, she reports the collapse of the existing evil, foreshadowing the end of the black streak in life and getting rid of a heavy load. It's time to enter the future under the roar of the wreckage of the past.";
"starCard_map_description" = "The star shows hope, changes for the better are taking place. The lasso symbolizes the sunrise, but the dawn is just coming. This means that a person will have any new ideas that he will be able to bring to life. He is sure that a better future will come soon, he dreams, makes plans. Maybe a new acquaintance or a new love will appear, existing disagreements will be overcome, mutual understanding will come, talents will develop, insight will descend on a person. Arkan says that the era of serenity has come, the difficulties are left behind, the prospects will be very promising. You need to wait, but inaction should not be in vain. Your wish will come true, and your plan will end happily. There is no need to wait for a new road to open right now, immediately. Or manna (gold, dollars, the minister's portfolio) will fall straight from heaven, but the prospect is about to appear over the horizon. Higher powers are ready to turn their favorable gaze on you, so they will definitely give you some kind of sign showing you the new direction of your path. Try to pay attention to secret signs. It can be the words or title of a song you heard by chance, the title of a magazine, an article in a newspaper, an ad on a lamppost, and more.";
"moonCard_map_description" = "The lasso testifies to something hidden and unconscious when it comes to the dark sides of a person, about his secrets. The card can hide such a secret that can result in danger. In a person's life, unpleasant moments can occur with the manifestation of emotions (envy, jealousy). And now is not the time to test yourself for strength, to show your courage. The card warns a person from danger, she advises him to be careful, tracking his every step. And all because many events that will take place will not always be subject to man. A person will face unpredictability. The information that he will receive will be incomplete, and all because the person himself refuses to face the truth. There is a danger of falling into someone's trap, sudden changes are not ruled out. A person will face difficulties and obstacles, but it will not immediately become clear how serious they are. It is very easy to stumble and make a mistake. If recently everything seemed clear, now darkness. It's like day and night. During the day we see one picture, and at night completely different sensations.";
"sunCard_map_description" = "The traditional meaning of this card is all the good things that can happen to a person. This is a general concept that includes a feeling of warmth, light, security, a positive outlook on the situation and the successful resolution of all problems. There is no need to say too much about this card as it speaks for itself. Just imagine dazzling, warming sunlight and write down your intuitive associations associated with it - all of them will be included in the symbolic field of the Arcanum. This is an ancient archetype familiar to each of us, so there is simply no need to supplement its interpretation. It is believed that this is the best, joyful, bright and kind card of the deck.
A good card that tells about the bright and sunny streak of life. A person has a period when he feels happy and lucky. It may be related to the birth of a child or another situation where something new and positive is happening. The person who gets this lasso is a cheerful person, he is confident in his own future. Any difficulties and disagreements are easy for him, as he knows how to specifically describe the situation. The Arcana Sun highlights a person who strives for bright, pure and high ideals. He is directed towards the light, overcoming all the dark sides of his personality. And he, in fact, expects great success in many areas of activity. In addition, he is doing great things at work. He achieves incredible success and triumph not only in his career, but also in purely personal matters. And with this lasso, he can successfully enter into a marriage in which they will reign: love, respect, prosperity, joy, success.";
"doomsdayCard_map_description" = "So, in most cases, the Arcanum of the Last Judgment will report that life is changing dramatically. The angelic trumpet loudly announces the coming of these changes. The dead who have risen from the graves symbolize the liberation from what fettered, hindered, did not allow to live a full life. Therefore, first of all, the meaning of the Supreme Court of the Tarot will be the following - a cardinal change for the better. How exactly it will manifest itself depends on the theme of the alignment and neighboring cards. There are other semantic shades. Since the dead were once alive, the card can describe the return of a person to the way of life that took place in the distant past. Often Arkan is also interpreted as retribution for sins committed in the past, while the previous incarnation can also be considered the past - thus reflecting the law of karma. If the Court card fell out in the Tapo layout, then you can count on a favorable interpretation. This is a hint that significant changes will soon come into life or the personality itself will be transformed. New goals, aspirations and intentions will appear. Some will discover new talents. However, remember that everything new comes with getting rid of the old. Therefore, we will have to cross out stereotypes and abandon outdated thinking.";
"worldCard_map_description" = "The lasso is the embodiment of good luck and contentment. A person under the influence of the World will experience a feeling of joy and harmony. He will be happy not only to relax, but also to do work. The World card already speaks for itself that a person must come to terms with the world around him. The lasso is filled with positive energy, as if a person acquires a personal paradise, achieves a long-awaited and longed-for goal.
